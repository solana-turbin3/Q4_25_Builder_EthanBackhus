I believe that Solana has chosen to use Typescript for Client side development because both Typescript and Javascript are both very powerful scripting
languages that are both very popular and have a lot of existing support. It would make sense to use Typescript over Javascript because it introduces strong
types, which Rust is also strongly typed. This helps reduces bugs, which is especially important when dealing with blockchain transactions because
mistakes are often irreversable and have real monetary consequences. Typescript is also a natural choice because Typescript and Javascript are what most
of the web is built on today, so it would be a natural transition for existing web2 developers. This would help onboard web2 devs to web3, so for these reasons
Typescript seems like the optimal choice.
